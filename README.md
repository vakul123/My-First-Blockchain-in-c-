# My-First-Blockchain-in-c++-
I started learning about this new technology during covid-19 lockdown.
I wanted to learn something new and which is known only to few.
So, I decided to learn about Blockchain and started subscribing to many blockchain courses available.
This is my first project showing a private blockchain of mine.
As i will learn further,I am going to do more projects on blockchain development as blockchain has fascinated me a lot.
I have used c++ in this project because c++ is my primary language but my next projects will be in python and node js.
I will try to become a full stack Blockchain Developer by the end of this covid-19 lockdown.
